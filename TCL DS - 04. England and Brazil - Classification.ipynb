    "In this workbook we will take our unplugged exercise and plug it in!  In the England or Brazil exercise we used our human brains to try to work out how to classify data samples from World Cups as either England or Brazil.  The samples contained the total goals scored in the tournament and the average attendance at games.  The data set was extremely small, so whilst it was handy to use as an example for manually classisfying samples, it's not the best for machine learning, where larger data sets would be better.  Nevertheless, it is useful to see how this same data set that we worked on manually could be processed by Python Machine Learning."
